# Agent Plugins

Build, improve, validate, evaluate, and package agent capabilities without tying their portable core to one runtime.

This distribution provides four guided creators for [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification), custom agents, hooks, and complete [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org/). Its portable outputs follow open Agent Skills and Agent Plugins specifications and are **runtime-agnostic by format**. Runtime-specific outputs are isolated and labeled explicitly. The integration suite is tested with [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/), an open-source [Agentic AI Foundation](https://aaif.io/) project. Compatibility with another host depends on that host implementing the relevant specification and has not been verified by this repository unless stated.

| Status | Value |
|---|---|
| Distribution | `0.5.0` |
| Portable plugin target | Agent Plugins `1.0.0` |
| Portable skill target | Agent Skills |
| Verified host integration | Goose `1.47.0` |
| Creator runtime | Native Bun release executables; Node.js `22+` only for source development |

## What you can do

Turn a concrete need into an agent capability, then prove whether it helps:

- **Create** portable Agent Skills and complete plugins from guided requirements instead of hand-writing fragile package structures.
- **Apply good practices** for concise instructions, progressive disclosure, safe paths, portable manifests, and explicit host adapters.
- **Validate** schemas, structure, references, packaging, and host-specific behavior before distribution.
- **Evaluate performance with paired A/B runs**: compare `with_skill` against an `old_skill` or `without_skill` baseline on the same scenarios.
- **Inspect a visual report** that combines outputs, grading evidence, timing, benchmark summaries, regressions, and reviewer feedback.
- **Improve from evidence**: revise weak instructions, rerun the same cases, and compare iterations without claiming gains that were not measured.

The goal is not merely to generate files. It is to produce maintainable capabilities with traceable evidence from idea to release.

## See it in action

### Create a Skill with good practices

> Use `agent-plugins:skill-creator` to create `.agents/skills/api-review`. It should review an OpenAPI diff for breaking changes and produce a concise Markdown report. Keep the Skill portable, apply progressive disclosure, add realistic evaluation cases, validate every reference, and show the resulting files.

**Expected outcome:** a valid `SKILL.md`, only the supporting resources the workflow needs, and explicit validation or evaluation gaps.

### Create and validate a complete plugin

> Use `agent-plugins:plugin-creator` to create `./release-assistant` with a portable Skill for drafting release notes. Keep the portable core compliant with Agent Plugins 1.0.0, isolate any host-specific behavior, validate in portable-load and strict-authoring modes, and show the package before writing a release archive.

**Expected outcome:** a valid `plugin.json`, portable components in fixed locations, separate host adapters when required, and a reviewable validation result before packaging.

### A/B test a Skill and understand improvements

> Use `agent-plugins:skill-creator` to evaluate `.agents/skills/api-review` against its previous version. Run the same realistic scenarios with the current Skill and the old Skill, grade both variants using explicit evidence, aggregate the benchmark, generate the static HTML review, identify regressions and trade-offs, and recommend only evidence-backed improvements.

The evaluation workspace preserves paired `with_skill` and `old_skill`/`without_skill` outputs. It produces `benchmark.json`, `benchmark.md`, and an HTML review such as `review.html`. Open the HTML file in a browser to inspect outputs and grading side by side. The analysis should explain:

- which assertions improved, regressed, or remained inconclusive;
- whether quality gains trade off against time or token use;
- which instruction or example likely caused each difference;
- what to change next and which unchanged scenarios must be rerun.

A complete report does not guarantee improvement: results remain `pass`, `fail`, `blocked`, or `na`, and missing evidence never becomes a positive claim.

## Choose your path

- **Create a portable Skill:** start with [Create a Skill with good practices](#create-a-skill-with-good-practices), then install `skill-creator` through a compatible host or as a standalone Skill.
- **Measure whether a Skill helps:** use [A/B test a Skill](#ab-test-a-skill-and-understand-improvements) to compare paired outputs and inspect the visual report.
- **Build or migrate a plugin:** use `plugin-creator` for manifests, MCP, packaging, integration evaluation, and release decisions.
- **Create host-specific behavior:** use `agent-creator` or `hook-creator`; these outputs are explicitly labeled as Goose-specific today.
- **Contribute to this repository:** follow [Contributing](#contributing).

## Choose the right creator

| I want to… | Creator | Output portability |
|---|---|---|
| Create, improve, or A/B evaluate one Agent Skill | `agent-plugins:skill-creator` | Open Agent Skills format |
| Create or evaluate a custom agent | `agent-plugins:agent-creator` | Goose custom-agent format |
| Create or validate a lifecycle hook | `agent-plugins:hook-creator` | Goose extension in a plugin |
| Create, migrate, validate, evaluate, or release a plugin | `agent-plugins:plugin-creator` | Portable core plus explicit host adapters |

Use the unqualified names—such as `skill-creator`—when a creator is installed standalone. A productive request names one deliverable, its destination, user outcome, constraints, and success criteria.

## Quick start

### 1. Check the requirements

Source development lives under `apps/<creator>-cli/` and requires Node.js 22 or later. The directories under `skills/<name>/` are portable Skill content: they do not contain the TypeScript application source or generated executables. Tagged release staging injects one native executable at `skills/<name>/scripts/<name>` (`<name>.exe` on Windows), so an installed release does not require Node.js or `npm install`. To load the Skills through an agent, use a host that implements the relevant Agent Skills or Agent Plugins specification.

Host discovery and installation commands differ. This repository verifies the complete integration with Goose. Other hosts may load the portable outputs when they implement the corresponding specification, but this repository does not claim untested host compatibility.

### 2. Install the ServierHub distribution with the verified Goose integration

```bash
goose plugin install --auto-update https://github.com/servierhub/agent-plugins.git
```

Omit `--auto-update` if you want to approve updates manually.

### 3. Verify discovery without creating files

Start a new Goose session and ask:

> Use `agent-plugins:skill-creator` to explain, without modifying files, what you need from me to create an Agent Skill.

Success means Goose resolves the qualified creator and asks for or explains the target behavior, activation conditions, workflow, and evaluation needs. If it cannot resolve the creator, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### 4. Create a first portable Skill

> Use `agent-plugins:skill-creator` to create `.agents/skills/markdown-summary`. It should summarize one Markdown file into key decisions and open questions. Keep the Skill portable, validate it, and show me the files created and any evidence still required.

A successful run creates at least `.agents/skills/markdown-summary/SKILL.md`, validates its format, and reports either completed evaluation evidence or an explicit `evaluation: blocked` state. Additional references, scripts, or evaluations are created only when the behavior needs them.

## How-to guides

Each guide identifies the request and the evidence of success. Exact supporting files depend on the requested behavior.

### How to create a portable Skill

**Use when:** you want repeatable instructions that compatible agents can discover through the Agent Skills format.

**Prompt:**

> Use `agent-plugins:skill-creator` to create `.agents/skills/api-review`. It should review an OpenAPI diff for breaking changes and produce a concise Markdown report. Include realistic evaluations, validate the result, and report any blocked evidence.

**Success:** `SKILL.md` has valid frontmatter and focused instructions; its directory name matches the Skill name; any referenced files exist; validation passes; behavioral evidence is reported separately.

### How to improve an existing custom agent

**Use when:** a Goose custom agent already exists under `.agents/agents/` and needs evidence-backed improvement.

**Prompt:**

> Use `agent-plugins:agent-creator` to evaluate `.agents/agents/security-reviewer.md` against its current baseline, improve only evidence-backed weaknesses, and report the benchmark delta.

**Success:** the custom-agent definition validates, paired evidence remains traceable, and the report distinguishes measured improvement from unavailable or blocked evidence.

### How to add a safe Goose hook

**Use when:** a plugin needs Goose lifecycle behavior. Hooks execute commands and are not part of the portable core.

**Prompt:**

> Use `agent-plugins:hook-creator` to add a safe `PostToolUse` hook to `./my-plugin`. Invoke a plugin-relative script, keep persistent writes inside plugin data, validate the hook, and explain its side effects.

**Success:** the plugin already has a valid `plugin.json`; the hook uses the canonical namespaced extension; referenced scripts exist and remain inside the plugin; executable behavior has been reviewed.

### How to validate or release a plugin

**Use when:** you need a conformance decision, migration, package, or release—not just one component.

**Prompt:**

> Use `agent-plugins:plugin-creator` to validate `./my-plugin` in strict-authoring mode, fix actionable errors, run applicable evaluations, and prepare a release only if every required gate has evidence.

**Success:** portable and host-specific resources are classified separately; strict validation passes; requested behavioral evidence and archive checks exist; missing evidence blocks rather than weakens a release gate.

From a source checkout of this repository, build the app first, then invoke its generated entrypoint directly:

```bash
(cd apps/plugin-creator-cli && npm install && npm run build)
node apps/plugin-creator-cli/dist/scripts/cli.js validate <plugin-directory> --mode portable-load --format json
node apps/plugin-creator-cli/dist/scripts/cli.js validate <plugin-directory> --mode strict-authoring --format json
```

## Installation and updates

### Complete plugin with Goose—verified integration

```bash
goose plugin install --auto-update https://github.com/servierhub/agent-plugins.git
```

For an installation without automatic updates:

```bash
goose plugin install https://github.com/servierhub/agent-plugins.git
goose plugin update agent-plugins
```

Goose 1.47.0 provides `plugin install` and `plugin update`, but no plugin uninstall subcommand. Use the removal procedure documented by your installed host version rather than deleting unknown runtime state manually.

### Other compatible hosts

Use the host's documented Agent Skills or Agent Plugins installation mechanism. There is intentionally no invented universal command: the file formats are open, while discovery and lifecycle management belong to each host. A host respecting a specification can consume the corresponding portable surface, but support must be verified per host and per component. Qualified creator names are a host presentation detail and may differ.

### One standalone creator from a source checkout

Clone the ServierHub distribution, then copy the self-contained creator directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/servierhub/agent-plugins.git
cd agent-plugins
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -R skills/skill-creator ~/.agents/skills/skill-creator
test -f ~/.agents/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md
```

The `.agents/skills` location is an emerging interoperability convention used by Goose and other compatible agents; confirm discovery rules in your host.

## Standalone Bun release assets

Tagged GitHub releases also provide native, runtime-only creator executables for supported Linux, macOS, and Windows architectures. See [Bun release assets](RELEASES.md) for the exact OS/architecture filename mapping and SHA-256 verification commands. Always verify the selected archive against the release's `SHA256SUMS` before extraction. The same guide covers PATH and direct invocation, avoiding mixed archives, and removing legacy Node/dist wrappers.

## Validation and evaluation

Validation answers “does the artifact conform?” Evaluation answers “does it improve behavior?”

- **`portable-load`:** models what an Agent Plugins 1.0.0 loader accepts, ignores, or isolates.
- **`strict-authoring`:** adds semantic, operational, migration, and safety policy; this is the authoring default.
- **Release:** additionally requires applicable tests, behavioral receipts, archive identity, and human review.

JSON commands return a stable envelope. Exit codes are `0` for success, `1` for failure, `2` for invalid usage, and `3` when required execution or evidence is blocked. A blocked evaluation is not a passed evaluation and is not necessarily a format failure.

```text
scenarios → paired isolated runs → grading → benchmark → review → release gates
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| A creator is not found | Start a new host session after installation; try the qualified name for a plugin install and the plain name for a standalone install. |
| Goose cannot start a creator | Confirm Goose has a configured model provider and the plugin installation completed without errors. |
| An old Node or `dist/` wrapper runs | Remove that legacy wrapper from `PATH`, then install the matching archive described in [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md). |
| An installed release reports a missing dependency | Treat it as an incomplete package; do not repair it with `npm install`. Reinstall a complete release and report the defect. |
| Validation fails | Read the structured diagnostics and correct the referenced path or field; do not bypass strict-authoring errors. |
| Evaluation reports `blocked` | Supply the requested model run, grading, timing, test, or human-review evidence, then resume the workflow. |
| Portable and Goose behavior seem inconsistent | Check whether the resource is portable core, a Goose-specific adapter, or a legacy migration input. |

## Formats, portability, and security

### Portable core

The active target is the published Agent Plugins 1.0.0 format:

```text
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json          # required
├── skills/review/       # optional Agent Skills
│   └── SKILL.md
└── mcp.json             # optional portable MCP configuration
```

`plugin.json`, direct children of `skills/`, and root `mcp.json` form the portable package surface. The vendored Agent Plugins 1.1.0 snapshot is an inactive Working Draft for analysis, not a supported target.

### Explicit host adapters

Custom-agent definitions and hooks currently target Goose contracts. New hooks live under `plugin.json.extensions["io.github.bioinfornatics.agent-plugins.goose"]` and point to `extensions/io.github.bioinfornatics.agent-plugins.goose/hooks.json`. Root `hooks/hooks.json`, root `.mcp.json`, and inline `plugin.json.mcpServers` are legacy migration inputs, not portable alternatives.

Hooks are executable behavior. Review generated commands, paths, credentials, blocking semantics, and side effects before enabling them. Never package secrets.

See [portable conformance](skills/plugin-creator/references/portable-conformance.md) and the [Goose adapter reference](skills/plugin-creator/references/goose-plugin-format.md) for normative detail.

## Contributing

### Root developer commands

Run `make help` for the facade over canonical npm scripts. `make test` runs all checks; `make bundle` stages the current OS/architecture runtime plugin under `release-staging/`; `make release OUTPUT=/path` builds all targets pinned in `bun-release.json`, validates each stage, then emits archives and `SHA256SUMS`. Release requires the pinned Bun plus `tar`, `gzip`, `zip`, and `sha256sum`.

`make install` installs only validated current-target staging and defaults safely to `.agents/plugins/agent-plugins` in this project. Override with `DEST=/explicit/path` or `SOURCE=/staged/path`; use `DRY_RUN=1` to inspect. Existing destinations are refused unless `FORCE=1`; symlinked destinations or ancestors are always refused.

Contributor dependency installation is separate from end-user installation. Creator application source, tests, and build output live in `apps/<creator>-cli/`; the portable `skills/<name>/` trees must remain free of generated JavaScript, TypeScript source, and binaries. From the repository root, these copy/paste-safe subshell commands preserve the working directory:

```bash
(cd contracts/capability-contract && npm install && npm run build && npm test) # capability, evaluation-plan, result-state, and host-adapter contracts
for app in apps/*-creator-cli; do (cd "$app" && npm install && npm run build && npm test) || exit; done
```

Release assembly is a separate root operation. It copies the configured portable entries, compiles the app entrypoints, and atomically publishes an immutable target tree under `release-staging/<os>-<arch>/`; do not edit that tree by hand. Bun must match the version pinned in `bun-release.json`.

```bash
npm run stage:release -- --target=bun-linux-x64-baseline
npm run test:executables
node scripts/package-bun-release-assets.mjs /path/to/matrix-artifacts /path/to/release-assets
```

Verify the complete offline distribution from the repository root:

```bash
npm run prepare:offline
npm test
npm run test:offline
