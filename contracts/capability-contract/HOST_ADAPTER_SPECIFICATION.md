# Host Execution Adapter Protocol 1.0.0

This process-neutral protocol lets an evaluation coordinator discover and invoke a compatible host without depending on Goose internals. TypeScript is the in-process binding; JSON request/response documents and one JSON event envelope per JSONL line are the wire binding. Goose command construction and full-eval integration are explicitly outside this package.

## Version and identity

Every report, run request, event, cancellation, resume, and artifact exchange records protocolVersion and host {name, version, adapterVersion}. Discovery selects an exact mutually supported protocol version. The report protocolVersion must equal that selected version, and requested streaming transport values (iterator or jsonl) are evaluated exactly rather than treating streaming as a boolean. No match returns PROTOCOL_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED before execution. Evolution and migration beyond exact 1.0.0 negotiation are deferred to the compatibility policy milestone.

## Capability negotiation

Reports explicitly declare isolation, streaming, cancellation, resume, supported models/tools, filesystem, network, browser, token metrics, cost metrics, and allowlisted environment variable names. Requests divide capability requirements into required and optional lists. Any unavailable required item blocks before started; every unavailable optional item produces an OPTIONAL_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE degradation in accepted. Silent fallback is invalid.

## Bound run request and security

A request binds run, plan, scenario, configuration, and attempt identities; the normalized EvaluationPlan itself. identity.planId is deterministically derived as sha256:<lowercase-hex> over the UTF-8 canonical JSON of plan, recursively sorting object keys by UTF-16 code unit while preserving array order, and attempt is a positive integer; scenario reference; workspace root, cwd and file descriptors; tools; environment names; credential references; model; EvaluationRunBudget; capability requirements; and idempotency data. It reuses EvaluationPlanV1, EvaluationScenarioReference, EvaluationRunBudget, and ResultContractV1 rather than redefining them. Every submission is fully validated before capability blocking or cached replay. A run ID and idempotency key replay only when a stored immutable SHA-256 fingerprint exactly matches the canonical validated request. The fingerprint covers protocol and host identity, run/plan/scenario/configuration/attempt identity, normalized plan, workspace/cwd/files, tools, environment names, opaque credential names and references (never resolved credential values), model, budget, capability requirements, the idempotency key, and afterSequence when supplied; the ephemeral resumeToken is excluded. A mismatch returns typed RUN_REQUEST_INVALID and never replays prior events.

Workspace root and cwd are absolute; cwd and every input/output/artifact path remain inside root after path resolution. A filesystem-backed host must canonicalize existing ancestors and reject symlink or junction escapes before access; lexical checks alone do not authorize I/O. File and artifact descriptors carry lowercase SHA-256, media type, and byte size. Tools and environment variable names are allowlisted by capability discovery. Environment values do not exist in the protocol. Credentials are opaque references and serialized credential values are forbidden. Closed JSON objects reject extra value-bearing fields. Event data cannot contain secret, password, credential, API-key, or access/refresh-token fields. Hosts must also redact sensitive free text before emission.

## JSONL lifecycle

Each line is one host-execution-event schema envelope with stable protocol/host/run identity, a positive contiguous sequence starting at 1, and RFC 3339 timestamp. Valid complete streams are:

- accepted, started, zero or more progress | heartbeat | artifact, exactly one completed | blocked | failed | cancelled;
- accepted, exactly one blocked | failed | cancelled for pre-execution termination.

No event follows a terminal event. completed, blocked, and failed carry a ResultContract whose operation state matches the event. Artifact events are metadata only; exchangeArtifact returns base64 content whose byte count and SHA-256 must match the descriptor. Events are resumable after a retained sequence without renumbering.

The JSON Schema is the structural wire contract: it closes event objects and enforces branch fields, types, and per-property numeric bounds. JSON Schema draft 2020-12 cannot portably express the cross-property numeric relation between progress.completed and progress.total. Runtime validation therefore adds the semantic invariant completed <= total when both properties are present. Structural schema/runtime acceptance is tested separately from this additional runtime-only semantic rule; full bidirectional parity is not claimed for that relation.

## Cancellation, resume, errors

Cancellation is keyed and idempotent: the first active request returns cancel-requested, repeats return already-cancelled, and completed runs return already-terminal on every repeated cancellation without mutating cancellation state. Cancellation produces one cancelled terminal event when execution observes it. Resume requires matching run ID, host/protocol identity, token, and retained afterSequence. Unknown/out-of-range resume data returns RESUME_INVALID; rotated, expired, or mismatched tokens return RESUME_STALE. Typed errors include version, capability, request, containment, allowlist, credential, event, artifact, cancellation, resume, and internal failures plus retryability and optional non-secret details.
