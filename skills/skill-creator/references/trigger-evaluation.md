# Trigger evaluation checklist

Read this reference when testing or optimizing Skill selection.

## Eval set

Create realistic `should_trigger` and difficult `should_not_trigger` queries. Include:

- explicit and implicit intent;
- formal, casual, abbreviated, and typo-bearing requests;
- multilingual requests while keeping the description English;
- close sibling capabilities;
- simple requests where loading the Skill adds no value;
- substantive requests where the Skill should clearly help.

Prefer at least 8–10 positive and 8–10 negative cases. Run each query multiple times when model variance matters.

## Metrics

Measure more than total accuracy:

- **precision:** relevant triggers / all triggers;
- **recall:** relevant triggers / all relevant requests;
- **F1:** balance of precision and recall;
- false positives by neighboring Skill;
- false negatives by intent category;
- variance across repeated runs and target models.


## Typed outcomes and efficiency telemetry

Each repetition now includes an additive, versioned outcome envelope. Outcomes are `triggered`, `not-triggered`, `timeout`, `host-failure`, `malformed-stream`, or `unsupported-telemetry`. The first two are classification decisions. The remaining four are infrastructure outcomes and are reported separately rather than scored as false positives or false negatives.

The envelope reports total duration and, when available, time-to-trigger, actual turns, allowlisted usage categories, and USD cost. Missing host telemetry is represented as `value: null` plus an explicit `unavailable_reason`; it is never inferred. Aggregate output adds the confusion matrix, false-positive and false-negative counts, trigger and total-duration distributions, infrastructure-failure counts, and per-field telemetry coverage. Existing `results`, `trigger_rate`, `triggers`, `runs`, `pass`, and `summary` fields remain available.

Stream processing is bounded. Non-JSON, oversized, excessive, or structurally invalid stream records produce `malformed-stream`; arbitrary event text and host errors are not copied into result artifacts.

## Optimization

Keep train and held-out test cases separate. Select the best description by held-out performance, not training accuracy. Do not expand descriptions into multilingual keyword lists or examples from the eval set.

```bash
node dist/scripts/cli.js trigger-eval \
  --eval-set <trigger-eval.json> \
  --skill-path <skill-directory> \
  --runs-per-query 3
```

For iterative optimization, use the description-optimization reference linked directly from SKILL.md.

## Sibling overlap

Evaluate all nearby Skills on the same difficult negatives. A description is not acceptable when it improves recall by stealing requests that belong to a sibling.

## Completion checklist

- Positive and difficult-negative coverage is balanced.
- Precision, recall, and F1 are reported.
- Held-out results drive selection.
- Sibling overlap is inspected.
- Multilingual semantic discovery works without multilingual metadata.
- Trigger evidence is separate from behavioral output evidence.
