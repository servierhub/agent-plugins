# Agent Skill authoring pattern catalog

Source: [Skill authoring best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices), reviewed 2026-08-23.

Read this catalog at two mandatory moments:

1. **Creation:** before drafting the structure, decide which patterns the task needs.
2. **Improvement:** after evaluation or observed usage, map each failure to a pattern decision before adding instructions.

For every pattern, ask: **Is it relevant here? Why? Where should it be applied?** Record the consequential choices; do not add patterns mechanically.

## Core authoring decisions

### Concise is key

**Use when:** always. Metadata is globally loaded and the activated `SKILL.md` competes with conversation context.

**Apply by:** removing explanations the model already knows, retaining only task-specific knowledge, decisions, constraints, and verification.

### Appropriate degree of freedom

Choose instruction precision from task risk:

- **High freedom — heuristic text:** use when several approaches are valid and context determines the choice.
- **Medium freedom — pseudocode or parameterized scripts:** use when a preferred pattern exists but controlled variation is useful.
- **Low freedom — exact scripts and sequence:** use when operations are fragile, destructive, compliance-sensitive, or consistency-critical.

Do not force low freedom onto exploratory work or high freedom onto a narrow, failure-prone operation.

### Test with all intended models

**Use when:** the Skill targets more than one model class or deployment.

**Apply by:** checking that smaller models receive enough guidance and stronger models are not over-instructed. Record unsupported model coverage instead of assuming transfer.

## Discovery and structure

### Consistent naming

**Use when:** always. Choose a specific gerund, noun phrase, or action-oriented name; avoid vague names such as `helper`, `tools`, or `data`.

### Effective description

**Use when:** always. Write English third-person discovery metadata that answers what the Skill does and when it activates. Include distinctive user intent and concrete domain terms, not implementation detail.

### Frontmatter contract

**Use when:** always. Require valid `name` and `description`; respect the 64-character name and 1,024-character description hard limits and avoid XML tags.

## Progressive disclosure patterns

Progressive disclosure loads metadata first, the common entrypoint after activation, and detailed resources only when their condition applies.

### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

**Use when:** the common workflow is short but advanced rules, APIs, examples, or variants are substantial.

**Apply by:** keeping the overview and direct links in `SKILL.md`; state when each reference must be read.

### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

**Use when:** one Skill spans independent domains, providers, frameworks, datasets, or product areas.

**Apply by:** creating one descriptively named reference per domain and loading only the selected domain. Keep shared rules in `SKILL.md`.

### Pattern 3: Conditional details

**Use when:** the task branches by operation, input type, environment, or state.

**Apply by:** put the decision point in `SKILL.md`, then link each substantial branch to its own reference. Keep small branches inline.

### Avoid deeply nested references

**Use when:** always. Link resources directly from `SKILL.md`; avoid reference-to-reference discovery chains.

### Table of contents for long references

**Use when:** a reference exceeds about 100 lines; require it above 300 lines. A table of contents exposes scope without forcing a full sequential read.

### 500-line entrypoint budget

**Use when:** always. Keep `SKILL.md` at or below 500 lines. If it approaches the limit, move conditional, domain-specific, example-heavy, or deep technical material to directly linked references.

## Rule-rich domain coverage

### Coverage matrix pattern

**Use when:** correctness depends on many deterministic rules, formats, versions, directions, lifecycle states, or classifiable edge cases.

**Apply by:** inventory the main rule space before implementation. Mark each cell as automated, semantic, unsupported, or not applicable. Create scenarios that cover every important in-scope cell. Automate reliable verdicts and reserve semantic review for genuinely contextual ambiguity. Read the rule-rich domain coverage reference linked directly from SKILL.md for the full checklist.

**Avoid:** equating minimality with the fewest files, implementing only one representative case, hiding deterministic gaps behind a generic semantic-review instruction, or exhausting the action budget on extended rules before the eval set and final validation exist. The target is breadth-first delivery of the smallest sufficient domain coverage.

## Workflow and quality patterns

### Sequential workflow

**Use when:** the task has dependencies, multiple stages, or steps that agents may skip.

**Apply by:** order prerequisites, actions, validation, and final verification explicitly. For complex work, provide a progress checklist.

### Feedback loop

**Use when:** output can be checked and corrected.

**Apply by:** run validator or rubric, inspect errors, fix, and repeat until the acceptance condition passes. Do not validate only at the end when earlier checks are cheaper.

### Conditional workflow

**Use when:** creation/editing, provider, format, state, or other branches require different procedures.

**Apply by:** make the branch decision first. Use conditional-detail references when branches become long.

### Plan-validate-execute with verifiable intermediate output

**Use when:** batch, destructive, complex, or high-stakes changes can be validated before mutation.

**Apply by:** create a structured plan artifact, validate it deterministically, execute only after it passes, then verify the result.

## Content patterns

### Avoid time-sensitive information

**Use when:** always. State the current method without date gates. Put necessary deprecated behavior in a clearly marked legacy section.

### Consistent terminology

**Use when:** always. Choose one term for each concept and use it throughout instructions, references, scripts, and outputs.

### Template pattern

**Use when:** output structure matters.

**Apply by:** provide an exact template for strict schemas or a labeled default for flexible reports. Match strictness to the real requirement.

### Examples pattern

**Use when:** format, tone, edge-case handling, or quality is easier to demonstrate than describe.

**Apply by:** provide concrete input/output pairs. Avoid redundant examples and move large example sets to a reference.

### Avoid too many options

**Use when:** always. Give one reliable default and only the escape hatches justified by materially different conditions.

## Evaluation and iteration patterns

### Evaluation-driven development

**Use when:** creating or materially changing a Skill.

**Apply by:** identify baseline gaps, define representative evaluations, measure the baseline, write minimal instructions, and iterate against evidence.

### Expert-author / fresh-user loop

**Use when:** improving instruction quality.

**Apply by:** use one agent/context to author and a fresh isolated agent to execute. Feed observed failures back into the authoring pass.

### Observe navigation behavior

**Use when:** evaluations or real usage show missed references, unexpected file order, ignored resources, or repeated reads.

**Apply by:** improve link wording and information placement. Move repeatedly required content toward `SKILL.md`; remove or better signal ignored resources.

### Team feedback

**Use when:** the Skill has multiple users or operational contexts. Capture activation misses, confusing instructions, missing cases, and divergent terminology.

## Executable Skill patterns

Apply this section only when the Skill bundles executable code.

### Solve, do not defer

**Use when:** scripts can handle expected errors or decisions deterministically.

**Apply by:** implement explicit, actionable error handling rather than failing and asking the agent to improvise. Explain constants and retry/timeout choices.

### Utility scripts

**Use when:** a repeated operation is deterministic, fragile, expensive to regenerate, or benefits from consistency.

**Apply by:** bundle the script and say whether the agent should **run** it or **read** it. Prefer execution for utilities; document inputs, outputs, and verification.

### Visual analysis

**Use when:** layout, spatial structure, rendering, or image-visible state matters.

**Apply by:** render the input or output to images and inspect those images rather than relying only on source structure.

### Verifiable intermediate outputs

**Use when:** an open-ended plan can be checked before execution. Prefer structured JSON or another machine-verifiable artifact and produce specific validation errors.

### Package dependencies

**Use when:** scripts require non-standard packages.

**Apply by:** list requirements, verify runtime availability, and account for offline environments. Do not assume installation or network access.

## Runtime and tool patterns

### Filesystem-oriented discovery

**Use when:** always. Use descriptive forward-slash paths and organize files by domain or feature. References consume no context until read.

### Fully qualified MCP tools

**Use when:** the Skill calls MCP tools. Use `ServerName:tool_name` to avoid ambiguity and tool lookup failures.

### Do not assume tools are installed

**Use when:** external packages, CLIs, MCP servers, or capabilities are required. Check availability, document prerequisites, and provide only valid fallbacks.

### Clear script intent

**Use when:** scripts exist. Distinguish “run this script” from “read this script as reference.”

## Anti-patterns

Reject or revise these patterns:

- Windows-style backslash paths instead of portable forward slashes.
- Too many equivalent approaches without a default.
- Deep reference chains.
- Vague names or descriptions.
- Time-sensitive branches in the common workflow.
- Inconsistent terminology.
- Magic constants and unhandled script errors.
- Assuming dependencies or tools exist.
- Generating deterministic utility code repeatedly instead of bundling it.
- Large conditional branches or example collections left in `SKILL.md`.
- Documentation written before representative evaluations reveal a real gap.
- A rule-rich script that implements one illustrative case while delegating automatable core rules to an unspecified semantic pass.
- Adding exhaustive machinery to a simple or subjective Skill with no evidence that the domain requires it.

## Pattern review

At creation and after every material evaluation, record a compact decision table for relevant patterns:

| Pattern | Relevant? | Evidence or reason | Apply where? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Appropriate degree of freedom | Yes/No | Task variability and risk | Section or script |
| Rule-rich domain coverage | Yes/No | Number of deterministic dimensions, formats, versions, directions, states, and edge cases | Rule matrix / scripts / evals |
| Progressive disclosure variant | Yes/No | Domain or branch complexity | `SKILL.md` / reference |
| Sequential or conditional workflow | Yes/No | Dependencies and decisions | Workflow section |
| Feedback loop | Yes/No | Available validator or rubric | Verification step |
| Template or examples | Yes/No | Output-shape ambiguity | Body / reference / asset |
| Utility script | Yes/No | Repeated deterministic work | `scripts/` |
| Visual analysis | Yes/No | Spatial or rendered fidelity | Workflow step |
| Plan-validate-execute | Yes/No | Mutation risk and verifiability | Workflow + script |
| Dependency or MCP guidance | Yes/No | External runtime requirement | Compatibility / body |

Do not copy every pattern into the Skill. The review exists to select the smallest set that addresses observed needs.
