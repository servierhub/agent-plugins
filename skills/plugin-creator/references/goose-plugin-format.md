# Goose Plugin Format Reference

Use this reference when creating, porting, auditing, or packaging an Agent Plugin for Goose.

## Contract status

| Contract | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Agent Plugins 1.0.0 | Published; active | The only portable generation and validation target |
| Agent Plugins 1.1.0 snapshot | Working Draft; inactive | Analysis only; its schema identifiers are unsupported |
| `io.github.bioinfornatics.agent-plugins.goose` | Repository-defined Goose adapter | Client behavior transported by 1.0.0 extensions; not portable semantics or claimed upstream ratification |

Never infer 1.1.0 support from schema similarity or semantic-version proximity.

## Published portable core

```text
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json                    # required
├── skills/review/SKILL.md         # optional
└── mcp.json                       # optional
```

Agent Plugins 1.0.0 defines no portable hooks, agents, commands, recipes, or alternate MCP locations. The manifest cannot redirect fixed discovery or contain inline components.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Reusable workflows"
}
```

The schema requires `$schema` and `name`; strict authoring also expects useful release metadata.

## Skills

Discover only immediate children of `skills/` containing a regular file named exactly `SKILL.md`. Do not recursively discover deeper descendants. Keep references and scripts inside that Skill directory. Frontmatter names remain unqualified even when Goose exposes a plugin-qualified load name.

## Portable MCP

Portable MCP exists only at root `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/mcp.schema.json",
  "mcpServers": {
    "database": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["server.js"],
      "cwd": "./data"
    },
    "remote": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://example.test/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Manifest and MCP schema versions must match. An empty `mcpServers` object is valid. Entries use an explicit closed `stdio`, `streamable-http`, or legacy HTTP+SSE `sse` variant. Do not package credentials in `env` or `headers`; keep paths contained. A declaration does not sandbox a process.

### Current Goose host compatibility

At Goose commit `dd8de0196716db393fa1cd146d92a5f46e05d1a1`, the plugin MCP loader defaults to root `.mcp.json`; it does not auto-discover root `mcp.json`. The host also accepts inline `plugin.json.mcpServers` or path configuration, which may explicitly select `./mcp.json`. Each loaded server requires `command` and Goose converts it to a stdio extension. Its serde structs do not deny unknown fields, so server `type` and top-level `$schema` are ignored: an explicitly selected portable stdio-only `mcp.json` can load unchanged. Portable `streamable-http` and `sse` entries fail because `command` is required and the loader has no remote transport mapping, not because their `type` field exists.

One portable `mcp.json` may therefore serve both contracts when Goose selects it explicitly and all selected entries are stdio with `command`. A separate `.mcp.json` host compatibility artifact may instead coexist: portable clients discover `mcp.json`, while Goose defaults to `.mcp.json` (or selects one approved path with `exclusive: true`). Block configurations that can activate duplicate servers, such as non-exclusive `./mcp.json` beside `.mcp.json`; do not impose an unconditional no-co-ship rule. Validate the portable and Goose contracts separately and never invent precedence.

## Goose hooks

Hooks are host-specific and outside portable core. New Goose output uses:

```text
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json
├── skills/review/SKILL.md
├── extensions/
│   └── io.github.bioinfornatics.agent-plugins.goose/
│       └── hooks.json
└── scripts/hook-command.sh
```

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "extensions": {
    "io.github.bioinfornatics.agent-plugins.goose": {
      "version": 1,
      "hooks": "extensions/io.github.bioinfornatics.agent-plugins.goose/hooks.json"
    }
  }
}
```

Agent Plugins permits client-specific objects under `extensions` but assigns no semantics to their children. This distribution's Goose adapter defines `version: 1` and `hooks`. Other hosts must not execute or claim validation of them.

Root `hooks/hooks.json` is legacy Goose compatibility input. An importer may translate it after host validation. New output uses the namespaced form. If both exist, fail rather than merge or risk double execution. Hook commands are executable code; use `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` for package-relative paths and review blocking behavior. See [goose-hooks.md](goose-hooks.md).

## Runtime dependencies

Document required Goose capabilities, MCP support, external CLIs, APIs, and environment variables separately from package contents. Never encode secrets or imply portable metadata installs host capabilities.

## Validation

Run the unified CLI from the installed `plugin-creator` directory:

```bash
plugin-creator validate <plugin-directory> --mode portable-load --format json
plugin-creator validate <plugin-directory> --mode strict-authoring --format json
```

`portable-load` models normative 1.0.0 loading and isolation. `strict-authoring` is the default and combines schema with Goose operational and authoring-policy checks. See [portable-conformance.md](portable-conformance.md).

For direct document-level schema diagnostics only:

```bash
plugin-creator validate <file-or-directory> \
  --type auto --mode strict-authoring --format json
```

This lower-level validator discovers only `plugin.json` and portable `mcp.json`; it does not treat legacy MCP forms as portable. Prefer unified validation for normal authoring.

## Installation and scope

```bash
goose plugin install https://github.com/example/my-goose-plugin.git
goose plugin install --auto-update https://github.com/example/my-goose-plugin.git
goose plugin update my-plugin
```

Installed plugins live under `~/.agents/plugins/<name>/`; project-local plugins may live under `<project>/.agents/plugins/<name>/`. Standalone Skills in `.agents/skills/` and custom agents in `.agents/agents/` are separate surfaces. A bundled `agents/` directory is not portable or assumed auto-installed.

## Porting map

| Source | Target |
|---|---|
| Agent Skill | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| portable MCP | root `mcp.json` with explicit transport |
| Goose `.mcp.json` or inline/path MCP | separate host compatibility file or reviewed portable migration; explicit `./mcp.json` path only for a Goose-compatible stdio shape |
| Goose hook | namespaced manifest envelope and canonical hook path |
| root `hooks/hooks.json` | legacy input; validate and migrate, never co-ship |
| custom agent | separate Goose custom-agent installation when requested |
| source-specific UI/tool | adapt or replace; do not claim portability |

Always distinguish portable file compatibility from target-host runtime compatibility.
